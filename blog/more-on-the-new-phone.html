<p>For any interested parties, the phone I now have is a <a href="http://www.samsungusa.com/cgi-bin/nabc/product/b2c_product_detail.jsp?prod_id=SPH-a620%2fVGA1000">Samsung A620</a>, which goes by a multitude of other technological monikers, including the Samsung VGA1000. It’s an A620 to most people though.</p>
<p>There are a number of nice features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>T9 text system for quick text entry</li>
<li>A bajillion types of ringers, including full audio (not just MIDI) ones</li>
<li>A built-in digital camera, featuring up to 640×480 resolution and a really tiny nearly worthless flash</li>
<li>SMS capability, although this feature was unknown to the salesperson at the time</li>
</ul>
<p>I must say that, overall, I’m pretty pleased. The one thing I’m not a fan of so far is that when I take a picture, there’s no way to attach the JPG to an email and send it out. I have to use Sprint’s Picture Mail system to send it out, which means that I will have to either accept that <a href="http://www.textamerica.com/">moblogging</a> is probably not going to happen, or I’m going to have to throw together some hack on my webserver. I wouldn’t mind doing that, so that I could possibly set up a moblog gallery rather easily. Worst case, if I really wanted to, I could take the time to move the pictures from Picture Mail over to my gallery, but I’m a lazy kind of guy. The more I can get the computer to work for me, the better.</p>
<p>Hope you’re having a great day!</p>
