I am so enthralled with Mac OS X. It is the greatest thing ever, at least in computing. I’ve been able to very effectively work on homework, as well as play World of Warcraft with Lisa, so it has been wonderful.</p>
<p>One of the things that helps make the Mac experience wonderful is <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/">The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a>, which keeps me in the know as to all things Apple. There’s about two hundred other sites out there dedicated to similar efforts, but I find that TUAW is the most effective. I’ve found a couple of posts there recently that I want to keep track of, so I’m going to jot them down here, in the event that it may interest others.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/apple-releases-xcode-2-2/">Apple releases Xcode 2.2</a>. I’ll be updating this weekend. Also, the article describes one way of getting both Apache 2 and Subversion going, which are things I’ve wanted to do recently, so the article has a lot of utility to me. Yay!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/bowie-arcade-fire-collaborate-on-itunes-fundraiser/">Bowie, Arcade Fire collaborate on iTunes fundraiser</a>. Seriously, how awesome? Bowie is great, as is Arcade Fire. The combination should be very excellent.</p>
<p>Also, just for the heck of it, here’s a direct link to Apple’s article on <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/subversionxcode.html">Getting Control with Subversion and Xcode</a>, which is only slightly out of date. I suspect that it’ll be easy enough to use anyways, as it’s only one revision behind on Apache. I’ll probably attempt installing these tools using <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a>, which I’m still a bit hesitant on, but I’ve had solid recommendations from a few people, so hopefully it’s pretty good.</p>
