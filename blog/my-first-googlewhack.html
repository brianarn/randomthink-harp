It’s searching for a two words that aren’t quoted, where the results in <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> only turn up one result for the search. There are also some conditions. Both words have to be able to be defined by <a href="http://www.dictionary.com">dictionary.com</a> or they don’t consider it a legal hit, and it also can’t be any sort of a wordlist. My first hit included the word Moogle, which isn’t defined at dictionary.com but is a creature in these games I play. My second find turned out to be a word list.</p>
<p>However, my third whack was a completely legit whack, and so now I’ve got it on <a href="http://www.googlewhack.com/tally.pl">The Whack Stack</a>! As of this posting, I’m number two down the list already, as someone else has submitted another above me. Over 210,000 have been submitted, and the page lists the last 2000. If you search for Brian Arnold, you should find my submission of “<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=pleochroic">pleochroic</a> <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=eschatological">eschatological</a>“. If you ask me what it means, well, I don’t quite think it has any specific meaning. I’ve included Google’s links to dictionary.com for each of the words defined. They’re both interesting words, and they really don’t go together well, but one person (and only one) managed to use them both in something that Google has indexed. Very exciting.</p>
