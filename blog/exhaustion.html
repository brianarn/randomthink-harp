I’ve been striving to catch up on homework, since I fell a bit behind due to recent events, but it’s not been terribly effective. I feel like this weekend, I’ll get some closure at the funeral. I mean, I watched him pass away basically, and I was there for the service last Saturday, but being there at the grave site will provide something beneficial, I hope.</p>
<p>If you’re the praying sort, would you keep the following in your mind?</p>
<ul>
<li>My mom, for comfort and strength for her at this time</li>
<li>My wife, for comfort and strength as well – it’s going to be hard to be apart even for such a short time, since it’s such an infrequent thing. We haven’t been apart in almost two years.</li>
<li>Me, for the strength to be there to support my mom, and peace in knowing that my dad is in a better place now</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks. The therapy inherent in this blog is amazing to me right now.</p>
