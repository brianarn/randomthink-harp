If you live in ABQ, we should play more. I have an idea on how to do that. If you don&#39;t live in ABQ and/or aren&#39;t interested in board games, you should probably skip this post.</p>

<p>While I was off and away at the amazing <a href="http://2013.jsconf.us/">JSConf 2013</a>, my latest board game acquisition (<a href="http://playtmg.com/products/belfort">Belfort</a>, from a Kickstarter) was delivered. I decided that I&#39;d use Logan&#39;s nap today to set it up. It amounted to having to apply 144 stickers (gross) to little wooden blocks along with popping of several chits for money and whatnot.</p>
<p>This afternoon, while he napped some more, I remembered that another board game I own (<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/michaelmindes/ground-floor-a-business-building-board-game">Ground Floor</a>, also from a Kickstarter) hadn&#39;t been set up either, and so I popped out pieces from 13 boards worth of game pieces for money and building improvements and whatnot.</p>
<p>I looked at these games as I set them up, and found myself thinking about the hobby. While I enjoy the process of setting up board games to be played, I really enjoy actually playing them too. I got to play a decent bit of games on my trip (which I should also blog about at some point soon), but it got me thinking about ways to play more games.</p>
<p>I still plan on doing my annual birthday party gaming event, but trying to do that more than once a year isn&#39;t something that I could pull off before we had Logan, and it&#39;s definitely not something we can pull now. Even with friends who do the occasional gaming day, the reality is that attending a day of gaming is simply not feasible for the time being.</p>
<p>In recent months, I&#39;ve managed to occasionally get in a board game during lunch with friends, but that&#39;s been hard to set up as well, and the time pressures of squeezing in a game over lunch means we have to play something with a 60 minute or less timeframe, and honestly, playing a 60 minute game at lunch means lunch is running too long anyways.</p>
<p>On my last night in Boston, I went to the <a href="http://loft.bocoup.com/">Bocoup Loft</a> to play games. I was feeling nervous because I didn&#39;t get there until like 8pm, and I was thinking about my 8am flight the next day and thinking I was going to be sacrificing some sleep in order to really get some games going.</p>
<p>Instead, we played one really good seven person round of 7 Wonders, then a couple of rounds of a little very light game, and that was it. I was there maybe two hours. However, I still had a lot of fun. It had the joy of getting some gaming going, without feeling like this weighty commitment.</p>
<p>So, all that being said, what I think I&#39;d like to try now is to organize a few gaming nights here and there at my home, but different from the gaming days in some important ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just a couple of hours. While I can&#39;t put together a long lunch or a full day very easily, Logan is very consistently in bed and asleep by 7:30pm, meaning 8-10pm would work well for me, and I suspect/hope for most people.</li>
<li>Just one game. Pick something and play it as many times as we can in the two hours. This likely means just one playthrough, but that&#39;s okay. We can then talk and reflect and move on.</li>
<li>Just a few people. No need to have a dozen or more people over. Enough to play. Most games only really work well with 3-6 people anyways. Not that I don&#39;t love the parties, but it&#39;d mess with the first couple of goals.</li>
<li>Keep it light. People often feel like the party is an obligation or a big commitment, and I want this to be a casual thing that people can do without feeling like it&#39;s an obligation or burden to attend.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m thinking of trying this out near the end of the month, probably on a Tuesday. I&#39;d like to run Belfort, which claims to be 90-120 minutes of play. Normally that&#39;d mean it&#39;s going to take more like 2-3 hours, but if people are willing to invest a little time beforehand, there&#39;s a fantastic series on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/WatchItPlayed">Watch It Played</a> that covers <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHvfN_pNBj_F-_E5NwUceptFLZ0eSj0OH">how to play Belfort</a> in pretty thorough detail. The first video shows game setup and describes turns, and the rest are a detailed playthrough.</p>
<p>Thoughts? Any interest?</p>
