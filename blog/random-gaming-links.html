<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.benheck.com/Games/Nintendo_projects/NES_Micro/NES_Micro1.htm">Meet the NES Micro</a> – This guy built a portable NES gaming system. Man, that would be so awesome. I still have my original NES (still works, too, last time I checked a couple of years ago), and easily 20 games. It would be great to be able to play them again in a portable form, even if the games are notably larger than the device itself.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_item.php?listing_id=30982">Mario meets Che</a> – Amusing. I don’t think I’d buy it, but, it’s still entertaining.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ianalbert.com/misc/gamemaps.php">Video Game Maps</a> – There are some amazing maps here. Talk about painstaking work. His work on Doom, Doom 2, and GTA: San Andreas are particularly amusing, and his work in Final Fantasy 2 (US) is so detailed and wonderful that it makes me want to go play through FF2 again. I absolutely loved that game. If there’s one FF they need to port to my Game Boy, it’s that one.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ashotoforangejuice.com/gmrisk.html">Risk via Google Maps</a> – Interesting. Maybe I’ll find time to play Risk via this system, at some point in my life, maybe.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sjgames.com/ninjaburger/">Ninja Burger</a> – I got to play this card game recently at my friend Mark’s house. It was an absolute blast. It’s got a similar mechanic to Munchkin, and as such it has a similar feel, but I quite enjoyed it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sjgames.com/illuminati/">Illuminati</a> – When I made the trek out to California for the Real Life Forums meet in June (previously <a href="http://www.randomthink.net/blog/2005/06/30/brain-dump/">mentioned briefly</a>), I got to play this game with a few people. It had a very different feel from either Munchkin or Ninja Burger, and was really quite fun. I was doing pretty well too, until one particular card was played, which totally wiped me out. Good times.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/3076/Puerto+Rico">Puerto Rico</a> – I’ve yet to play this game, but I’ve heard nothing about good things about it. It’s got the highest ranking of any game on <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/">BoardGameGeek.com</a>, and that says something.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.twilightcreationsinc.com/zombies/">Zombies!!!</a> – I would buy this game in a heartbeat, if I thought that Lisa might possibly play it once. However, recently we were at <a href="http://www.aigamestore.com/">Active Imagination</a>, and I showed her the box, saying that I doubt she’d ever play it with me. After looking at the box for about, oh, three seconds or so, she said I was right, and so I put it back down. Maybe I should buy it for the sake of having a complete gaming collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>I initially started this post off with video games in mind, but wound up rambling off into board games. Maybe that means I need to be playing some more board games soon. Maybe sometime in early December, I can organize another board gaming night. My last one was actually a solid success, with plenty of people showing up to play.</p>
