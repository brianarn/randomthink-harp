<blockquote>
<p><strong>crapulous</strong> KRAP-yuh-luss (adjective)</p>
<ol>
<li>Marked by intemperance especially in eating or drinking</li>
<li>Sick from excessive indulgence in liquor</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So, keep in mind that saying that you are crapulous after a night of drinking is actually a valid word. It’s like the opposite of fabulous after a heavy night of drinking.</p>
