<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css"><title>Moving into Octopress</title></head><body><p>So, some months ago, I set up a new blog on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> because I wanted to play
around with <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, and I spent some time making it look half decent.  It
wasn&#39;t bad (okay, yes it was) and it worked and then I got lazy and haven&#39;t done
much with it.</p>
<p>Then a few days ago, <a href="http://www.rebeccamurphey.com/">Rebecca Murphey</a> wrote up <a href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2011/07/25/switching-to-octopress/">a post</a>
about her recent shift to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, which is basically a nice framework for
Jekyll. It sets up some nice themes and uses <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> to make it super easy to
customize the really beautiful layout.</p>
<p>I hopped into the #octopress channel on <a href="http://freenode.net/">freenode</a>, asked a question or two,
got immediate responses, and basically I was able to move my <code>_posts</code> directory
from before into the Octopress setup. It&#39;s built to deploy to GitHub Pages as
well, meaning it was ridiculously easy to get the &quot;new&quot; site up.</p>
<p>Of course, I wrote all of two blog posts before, but <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> has a few
niceties to make blogging a bit smoother. It&#39;s very easy to pull in code
snippets for display, including from <a href="http://gist.github.com">gists</a>. I wonder how hard it&#39;d be to
make a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">jsFiddle</a> plugin...</p>
