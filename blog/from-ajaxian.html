<p>If you’re finding this blog for the first time from my <a href="/labs/html5drums/">HTML5 Drum Kit</a> from <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/its-friday-play-some-drums-html5-style">this post on Ajaxian.com</a>, welcome to my meager site!</p>
<p>I feel like a cobbler who has no shoes of his own – or perhaps, one that is wearing a brand name instead of his own. I haven’t invested proper time on my personal site. For that I apologize. I’m working on a better version (possibly either a custom CMS or moved into ExpressionEngine). Hopefully I’ll get to do that over the fourth.</p>
<p>I’ve done a few other things, namely some stuff with <canvas> a year ago or so. It’s all in the <a href="/labs/">RandomThink Labs</a>, which are all pretty ugly right now visually, but hey, that’s part of the cleanup/rework I want to undertake. All the code in the labs is under an MIT license and also available at <a href="http://github.com/brianarn/lab/tree/master">this GitHub repo</a> if you want to just grab it all.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
