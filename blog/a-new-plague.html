<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css"><title>A new plague</title></head><body><p>Since my blog is fairly low-traffic and low-comment, I have it configured to send me an e-mail whenever someone posts a comment. I get sporadic comments on really old posts that people happen to find because of <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> or <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> or whatever search engine might index my site, and usually these comments are interesting. I had one person who commented on my <a href="http://www.randomthink.net/index.php?p=89">post on vegetarian buffalo wings</a> a few months after I wrote it. If it weren’t for the comment notification, I’d have never found it.</p>
<p>However, I received a new type of comment today. I think some months ago, someone posted a comment that was just basically an ad trying to drive traffic to their site. I’m sure he got all of zero hits from it. This new comment today though, was a link to questionable content. If I describe it at all, it’ll drive more of that traffic my way (something that’s happened before – <a href="http://www.randomthink.net/index.php?p=70">see reference</a>), so I think I’ll avoid mentioning it, and I’ll just say that I’ve already deleted the comment.</p>
<p>It’s not like my site is high traffic – do they really think they’ll get visitors by posting on my site?</p>
