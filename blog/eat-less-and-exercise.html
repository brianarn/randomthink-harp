<p>This joke was really funny back in 1987. I’m sure it’d offend some people today, but oh well. I’m all for political correctness, but it’s important to laugh at yourself now and again. This strip was part of a whole series, and I’ve taken the time to grab a couple more for your pleasure.</p>

<p>Bloom County was such a great strip.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I know that I need to eat less and exercise more, so hopefully having the government remind of that will help. I’ve eaten less today, but that’s probably more out of sloth than out of effort. My current music seems rather apt to the situation.</p>
<p>As for other actions I’m taking now to work on improving myself, I’m reading through <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>, which is great so far. I’m also trying to use my PDA more, as I purchased it and used it a lot for awhile, then didn’t use it for much, and went back and forth with usage. I don’t want to be come so dependent on it that it’s all I stare at, but it’d be a useful tool to help me reach my goals, if I use it properly.</p>
<p>Let’s hope we see some improvement.</p>
