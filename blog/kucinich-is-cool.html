I’m not nearly into the thing as much as some people are, but I use it from time to time to keep tabs on some friends and such. I’d received a friend request recently, and I generally don’t like to leave stuff like that sitting around in there or I just never bother with it (and lately I’ve gotten real, actual, genuine requests from people I know from high school and such), so I went to log in and check out the person.</p>
<p>Turns out that the friend invite was some band from New Mexico that I know nothing about, so that gets ignored — but I was very amused by something below the login box.</p>
<p>See, they list “Cool new people” there — I have no idea what the criteria are to be a cool new person is, but still, I was highly amused when greeted by this box of cool people.</p>
