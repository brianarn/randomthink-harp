<p>Through a small chain of events this evening, my mind got stuck on my stepdad, John, who passed away roughly a year and a half ago. Here’s<a href="http://www.randomthink.net/blog/2003/04/21/a-passing/"> my initial post regarding his passing</a>, for reference.</p>
<p>When I think about him, it’s like picking a scab. Over time, the wound is healing, and doesn’t hurt so much to look at. It’s even a good thing, kind of like cleaning it out. However, somehow tonight I managed to poke and prod so much that I hit a nerve. It’s a good sad, a cleaning and cathartic sort of sad, but it does hurt, quite a bit.</p>
<p>John passed away (still hard to write “died”) due to lung cancer. He was a habitual smoker. I recall someone making a comment (not specifically about him) shortly thereafter (on easter, I believe) about how smokers die happy. I can attest to you that if their passing is due to the cigarettes, it’s not a happy passing. I don’t normally give people crap about smoking, but it’s probably the one habit that I can’t stand, with a passion. It makes me so angry that people would so willingly do such a thing to their bodies. It’s a well-known fact now, many facts actually, about how harmful it is, and yet people still do it, including my mom and my new stepdad.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, my mom got married last week. Norm is a great guy. I like Norm, and I know how much he loves my mom, so I’m alright with it (although I wish I could have been at the wedding – long story for another night). They both smoke though, and it makes me so sad and angry. Mom, on the offhand chance you run across this post (about one in ten-thousand odds, probably), please stop. Please.</p>
