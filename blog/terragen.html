<p>I was playing around with some software called Terragen – run a google search to find the URL. I used to play with this program before, but it’s gotten a lot better. This took about 20 minutes, most of which was just render. I generated a random landscape, picked a camera angle I liked, upped the water level, and bam, I had a nice little landscape. It blows me away, seriously.</p>
