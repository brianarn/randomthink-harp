either 6 or 8 is really hot, and dominates the rolls. I realize that they&#39;re
common rolls, and that 7 is theoretically the most common roll, but it never
quite seems that way, that either 6 or 8 is dominant. It also seems like 5 or 9
is way more frequent than its statistical pairing, and I&#39;ve wanted an easy way
to track these stats in the past.</p>

<p>So, I thought, &quot;Hey, I know how to code, it would be a simple UI in a browser,
with minimal JS needs, just make it already.&quot; I got out my notebook and sketched
out some ideas on UI... and then let it sit for quite awhile. I&#39;m pretty sure
it&#39;s been at least six months, if not more.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been kind of bothering me for awhile now, and even though we don&#39;t play
Settlers as much these days (<a href="http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=278">Dominion</a> is amazing), I&#39;ve <em>still</em> wanted to
build it. Tonight, finally, I just sat down for a couple of hours and poked it
out of my head, and called it <a href="http://brianarn.github.com/ScoreSettler">ScoreSettler</a>.</p>
<p>You can now go <a href="http://brianarn.github.com/ScoreSettler">try it out</a> or <a href="http://github.com/brianarn/ScoreSettler">clone/fork the source</a> for yourself.
It&#39;s all here on GitHub, right alongside this blog. I&#39;d call it a proof of
concept at this point, which means that if I never come back to it, I can still
consider it complete, right?</p>
<p>I make no claims as to the quality of the code. It&#39;s fairly simple and requires
a modern browser (which means no IE &lt; 9), as I&#39;m not using any JS libraries to
do anything. It&#39;s just plain and simple JS, using event listeners. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s
not perfect, that there&#39;s spots to optimize, that it could use a better coat of
paint, but hey, it works.</p>
<p>It even has a rolling simulator, which I was using for testing. It&#39;s kind of fun
to just watch it roll away though.</p>
<p>Heck, it works on the iPad, meaning I could, in theory, use it right now -- and
that&#39;s awesome.</p>
<p>So, yeah. Feel free to <a href="http://brianarn.github.com/ScoreSettler">go play</a>, or <a href="http://github.com/brianarn/ScoreSettler">fork it</a> and make it pretty or
something. It&#39;s nothing that huge or exciting, but I&#39;m glad to have it out of my
head now, and I look forward to tracking my next game of <a href="http://www.catan.com/catan-games/boardgame.html">Settlers</a> to
see how the dice are screwing me.</p>
