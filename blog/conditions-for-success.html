<blockquote>
<p>Don’t create success. Create the conditions for success.</p>
<p>— Andrew Hedges (@segdeha) <a href="https://twitter.com/segdeha/status/97770601162354688">July 31, 2011</a></p>

<p>Doing some quick Googling, I’m sure it’s not exactly the most original quote<br>ever, but it’s one that really resonated with me. It made me think about what<br>I’m working on doing with my next <a href="http://ignite-nm.com/">Ignite NM</a> talk, which I titled “Doing<br>what you love: Making a hobby into a career”.</p>
<p>I owe a good deal to Andrew and a bit to dumb luck, but in a way, I’m doing<br>what I am these days not because I went and made my own way, so much as I made<br>myself ready for when the opportunities presented themselves.</p>
<p>In my case, I wanted to work on JavaScript full-time. I could have gone and<br>become a contractor or consultant or something, but instead, I polished my<br>skills. I worked on improving. I read and studied. I spent free time<br>experimenting. I created the conditions for success such that when the<br>opportunity presented itself, I was ready for it, and I couldn’t be happier.</p>
<p>Are you doing what you love? If you aren’t, why not?</p>
