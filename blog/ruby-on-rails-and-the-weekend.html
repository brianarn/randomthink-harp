<p>This week at work has been busy but also uneventful. I don’t feel like I’ve gotten as much done as I’d have liked. That bothers me.</p>
<p>For the coders out there, I started dabbling with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a>. I have to say, after overcoming some initial difficulties, I am quite enamored of it. I don’t think I’m going to go all hardcore and say that Ruby is the best language ever and it’s all I’ll ever use again, but I will say that it’s pretty slick. It’s interesting to be able to apply the whole Model-View-Controller paradigm to web-based database driven applications. I’ve actually got a blog meme I’d like to create at some point, and so I’m thinking that I’ll use Ruby on Rails to be the engine behind it.</p>
<p>At some point this weekend, anywhere from within the hour to Sunday, Lisa and I will be hanging out with my good friend Anthony and his girlfriend Audra. I suspect good times will be had. Other than that, I don’t rightly know what the weekend holds. I think Lisa is going to be doing something with a friend of hers, which means I will probably have a couple of hours to play with Ruby on Rails, and that will be fun.</p>
<p>I’m so glad that there are so many programming languages out there. It’s fun. It keeps things interesting. There’s always something new to learn. It’s a blast to dabble with Ruby. Perl is still my first love, but Ruby is enjoyable nonetheless. Besides, once I’ve done something with it, I can always add it to my résumé, right?</p>
<p>I guess that’s it for now. More later!</p>
