<p>I completely forgot about this – over the weekend, my mom shared a picture with me that I thought we’d lost some years ago.</p>
<p>You see, I have this unique ability with my feet – it’s not super unique I suppose, I met someone else once who could almost go as far as I can. I can twist my feet back pretty darn far. For those mathematically inclined, I’d say that if feet facing forward is 0°, I can twist each foot out about 135° or so. At some point the Image::Magick Perl module got put on the server, so you can have this pretty little thumbnail as a quick sample. Click the thumbnail image to see a popup window with the full-size image.</p>
<p>For reference purposes, this picture was taken on 4 May 1997, as I was dressed up for my senior prom. This night was memorable for being one of the worst dances I had been to. At least I have one good thing I took away from the night.</p>
