<p>This is all first pass. To the best of my memory, I haven’t repeated a song yet (at least, within a specific difficulty). Also, Trogdor and Thunderhorse are absolutely awesome bonus songs, and those are the only bonus songs I’ve hit yet.</p>
<p>I’ve also unlocked all songs, all characters, all outfits, all videos, all core guitars, and the fish and snaketapus guitars.</p>
<p>I am an ADDICT. It’s awful and I love it.</p>
