<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css"><title>Split Personality</title></head><body><p>So, I haven&#39;t written a post on this blog in nearly two years. <a href="http://www.randomthink.net/blog/what-a-crazy-year/" title="What a crazy year">What a crazy
year</a> was the last real one, and so much has changed since then that it&#39;d be
hard to summarize. However, that&#39;s not necessarily what this post is about.</p>
<p>Lately I&#39;ve had a real urge to get back into blogging. I don&#39;t always have time
to sit and write novels, but I do find chances here and there where I can put a
few thoughts out. For example, I have three draft posts on JavaScript topics and
one on what it&#39;s like to be a new parent (there&#39;s something drastically
different in the time since the last post), but the thing is, the audiences for
those topics are drastically different.</p>

<p>Navel gazing regarding blogging isn&#39;t new for me. Really, my concern is crossing
the streams. I suspect I still have some family and friends who&#39;d like to read
the personal stuff but don&#39;t know what a closure is, while others would be
potentially interested to read my technical thoughts but could care less about
my child&#39;s latest developmental milestone.</p>
<p>This blog is personal and there&#39;s a lot of old old content in it, and I&#39;ve
considered gutting it before and am considering it again, because of the two
dozen domains I own, it&#39;s still probably my favorite one and will always feel
like home, but I feel bad causing linkrot.</p>
<p>I created <a href="http://brianarn.github.com/">brianarn@github</a> the last time I got this urge, and that was a fun
experiment with Octopress, but something about having it be a subdomain of
GitHub feels a bit funny or odd. I&#39;ve considered buying a domain or using one of
the handful of variations on my name that I already own, but then it feels like
maybe I&#39;m fragmenting my web presence or whatever.</p>
<p>So, I figure, I&#39;ll reach out this time. What do people think? If you have
similar issues, how do you handle it? Separate blogs? Categories? Whoever you
are, if you know me and you&#39;ve read this, in particular if you have some
experience in this area, please let me know. I know some people just mix it all
up, and I&#39;d be open to that, but it feels like I really need to segregate topics
in some way and I&#39;m just not sure how best to do that.</p>
