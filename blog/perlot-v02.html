<p>So I play this <a href="http://www.legendsofterris.com">game</a> online, but they have a custom client to play, and it’s Windows-only. I’m often in Linux, so I’m making my own client, and since the game is Legends of Terris, or LoT, my Perl client is going to be called perlot – here’s a basic screenshot, I hope to add more to it soon.</p>
