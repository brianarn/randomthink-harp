</title></head><body><p>I recall hearing Howard Dean in a commercial saying a variant on the “I approve this message” statement, roughly in the format of “My name is Howard Dean, I’m running for president, and I approve this message because of X reason here.”</p>
<p>Then, I saw a Wesley Clark commercial, where at the end of the ad it would show a static picture of his face all huge with him doing a voice-over of “My name is Wesley Clark and I approve this message.”</p>
<p>These went on for awhile – Dean saying he approved his messages and why he did, and Clark usually doing a voice-over (once or twice doing it in-person on camera), but usually just stating his approval.</p>
<p>Then, I saw an ad with Dennis Kucinich, and at the end of it, he said, “Do I approve this message?” followed by it zooming in on his face and him saying “You bet!”</p>
<p>At this point, I was very frustrated. I had never heard candidates saying these things before, and it seemed to me that they were all ripping on Dean’s style, as he was the first I had heard doing it. However, recently the following was brought to my attention: <a href="http://www.wrf.com/publications/publication.asp?id=135852152004">TV and Radio Disclaimer Requirements of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out that they are required to say such things at the end of their ads. It doesn’t bother me as much now, but it’s still a bit annoying in a way – at least, the way that Clark does it. I like Dean’s approach when it comes to the phrase. No point in doing silly camera tricks, just say that it’s approved and say why, and I’m happy.</p>
