<p>So, if you were around back in, say, somewhere in 2003, there was this post on <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/">Something Awful</a>‘s Forums (generally not safe for work if you go past the front page) where someone posted a ton of photographs of his crazy mom’s collections from eBay. I’m fairly certain that <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ajbrown">Adam</a> was the person who linked me to this collection. Well, I found it so amusing that I created a <a href="http://www.randomthink.net/misc/ebay/">Crazy eBay Mom Mirror</a> of the photographs, with a link back to SA Forums. That was the end of it.</p>
<p>At least, so I thought.</p>
<p>Somehow, it got into Google and then started showing up on some forums, and then some more forums, and then some more forums, and now it’s been linked by the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/04/27/DI2005042700793.html">Washington Post</a> near the end of this article. When I look at my server logs, I see that in April, I served out over 156GB of data with 32,626 unique visitors, which blows my mind in and of itself, but this month we’re already up to 15,169 unique visitors and 73.28GB served out. That’s in just three days, and not even three complete days. Today alone is already up to 35GB and it’s still mid afternoon.</p>
<p>I guess that really, the numbers are still low compared to the iPod mini ad that I mirrored, which hit over 240GB in December last year, but still, it’s crazy to see it happening. If I’m already up to 73GB in just three days, it makes me wonder what’s going to happen over the month. I wouldn’t be surprised to see it break the old record that the iPod mini had held.</p>
