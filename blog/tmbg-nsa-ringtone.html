<p>Let me share this lovely link to a <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">boingboing.net </a> article. Basically, They Might Be Giants has recorded a little MP3 singing about the NSA violating privacy on phone calls. It’s really quite amusing.</p>
<p>That being said, normally I’m not sure that I’d blog about this ringtone — but, I wanted to point something out.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the article, it has two little words: “Brian sez”. That’s because I ran across this song surfing last night, and submitted the link to BoingBoing. My submission made it onto the site! That makes me incredibly happy. It’s not the first time I’ve been on BoingBoing – I’m currently still mirroring a Beatles mashup song that still get traffic from them, even though it’s been ages since that post, but it wasn’t my original content. This one is something I submitted, which makes me giddy happy to see it show up on the main page.</p>
