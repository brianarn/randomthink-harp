  Hi! I'm Brian Arnold. I'm sorta-relaunching my personal site, but still working out exactly what I want to do. I'm totally open to suggestions, if you have any. For now, though, this is what I'm doing. Please don't hate me for it. I'm a JavaScript guy, not a designer.

  I'm a software developer living in the southwest, living and breathing JavaScript. I have a beautiful wife and have for over twelve years now, and we have a cute little boy and two adorable puppies. Life is pretty great.

  Anyhow, here's a few places you can find me, where I am active in varying degrees. Also, typically, anywhere that a username is involved, I'm brianarn - except YouTube, someone beat me there, and AIM (had it, but had to give it up when I quit working for AOL), but that's about it. Anyhow, links ahead.

  * [@brianarn](http://twitter.com/brianarn) on Twitter — probably the easiest way to reach me, though that username at Gmail also works - y'know, if you like email.
  * [My blog](/blog), which I'm kind of rebooting, so check it out.
  * [brianarn on Facebook](http://facebook.com/brianarn) — I typically don't add people I don't really know, but if you know me and I know you, friend me maybe? I post pictures of my kid and more personal stuff here.
  * [Photos on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brianarn) - Not used often, but it's a thing
  * [brianarn on Github](http://github.com/brianarn), which are mostly half-finished, but you can also find the full source to my labs on there. Mostly JavaScript because that's what I love these days, and likely will for a long time.
  * [My YouTube profile](http://youtube.com/brianarnold79) — not that I ever really post video, but hey, I mentioned that I don't have brianarn there, so I figured I should link it.
  * [Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/#3u21Tw0w0w0w0), with a template I'm considering for this site. The root blue is what you see as the background here. That link is set to complement, though I'm also considering triad.
  * I've often on [freenode](http://freenode.net/), typically in `#dojo` and a few other rooms. My username there is brianarn, but if you've read this far you likely knew that.

  As part of the relaunch, here are a few recent blog posts

- var count = 0;
ul
  for article, slug in public.blog._data
    if count < 3
      - count++;
      li
        a(href="/blog/#{ slug }") #{ article.title }
